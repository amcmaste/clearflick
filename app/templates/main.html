                <span id="summary-text"/>On Isla Nublar, a new park has just been built with genetically engineered dinosaurs. Tragedy strikes when one of the workers is killed by a velociraptor. The founder of the park, John Hammond, (Sir Richard Attenborough) requests Paleontologist Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill) and his assistant, Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) to come to the park and ensure that it is safe. Also joining them are Hammond's lawyer Donald Gennaro (Martin Ferrero) and chaotician Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum). When they reach the island, they are amazed to discover that Hammond has created living dinosaurs. However, at the same time, they all have their doubts. Later, Hammond's grandchildren Lex and Tim (Ariana Richards and Joseph Mazzello) join the group in a tour of the park. Sattler leaves the tour to take care of an ill triceratops. Soon the power in the park is shut down by computer systems geek Dennis Nedry (Wayne Knight), who wishes to steal embryos from the park to sell to a secret buyer. In the process, many dinosaurs escape their paddocks, including the deadly Tyrannosaurus Rex, who, during a thunderstorm, escapes his paddock and attacks the children, and eats Gennaro. Malcolm is injured and Grant and the children are then lost in the park. Meanwhile, Hammond, Sattler, and the rest of the operations team learn that Nedry (who in the meantime has been killed) has locked up the computer system to cover his tracks. They attempt to get power back in the park in order to escape the island. After shutting down the system, then restoring it, the group realizes that velociraptors are also on the loose, and are now on the hunt for the visitors.</span>

                            <span>Michael Crichton's method is a concept that may one day be possible but, at present, we cannot create something even close to the original animal. The ethical and religious issues alone are enough to stop the development of one anyway. Crichton was fully aware of this when writing the story, but he needed a way for dinosaurs to exist in modern day. So, he created a plot device using cloning. In the book, however, it was explained that these were not exact replicas of their prehistoric ancestors but "Dr. Henry Wu's creations" made from fragments of DNA available, and corrected and changed according to the needs of the client, Mr. Hammond. The animals replicated in this way would have represented a truly towering achievement in the biological sciences -- the manufacture of fully synthetic organisms with structures based on theoretical models as opposed to truly observed biology. That the dinosaurs thus manufactured display the characteristics of natural organisms, including responding to environmental pressures (such as the all-female population, and lysinergic biochemical pathway degradation) increases the magnitude of the achievement. To put it simply, these are manufactured creatures made to look and act as real dinosaurs would have, but they are not 100% clones. Although scientists have been able to create totally synthetic life and, at least theoretically, if you used the DNA of a bird (the current believed closest relative to the dinosaurs) to fill in the gaps, you could create a dinosaur-like animal. This also explains how the dinosaurs were able to spontaneously change sex, whereas real dinosaurs presumably wouldn't have this ability. It may also explain the ferocity of some dinosaurs that in real life may not have been quite as hostile such as the Spinosaurus in Jurassic Park III.
